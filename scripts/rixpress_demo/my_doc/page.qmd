The command below loads the path to `mtcars_head`. It is a csv
file, so the path gets returned:

```{r}
rixpress::rxp_read("mtcars_head")
```

But if it were an R object, it would be shown directly, like
for `mtcars_mpg`:

```{r}
rixpress::rxp_read("mtcars_mpg")
```

Python objects also get shown automatically:

```{r}
rixpress::rxp_read("mtcars_pl")
```

The lines below come from another QMD file and are included here
using the `include` shortcode:

{{< include content.qmd >}}
